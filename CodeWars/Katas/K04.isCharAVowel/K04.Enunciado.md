Given an array of numbers, check if any of the numbers are the character codes for lower case vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

If they are, change the array value to a string of that vowel.

input [100,100,116,105,117,121]=>[100,100,116,"i","u",121] output Return the resulting array.

ðŸ§  Lo que aprendÃ­

- String.fromCharCode(string)
    it gives back the character to which the code belongs
    https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode

-   if ('aeiou'.includes(char)) {
      a[i] = char;
    }

    'aeiouAEIOU' / string... .includes(char)
        check if any of the characters is included / is the char. 
        it does not read it as a string all together, just character by character
        no need to declare variables or make it more complicated

- the excercise does not ask for a new string but the same one, I don't need to create a new one. 

ðŸ’¬ 
- No poner igual a, sino ->    i < a.length
- Read twice the exercise 
- mostly it is easier than I planned, break down steps to reach the goal
